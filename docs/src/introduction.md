# Introduction to `code2prompt`

`code2prompt` is a powerful command-line tool designed to generate large language model (LLM) prompts directly from your codebase. It simplifies the process of combining and formatting code, making it easy to analyze, document, or refactor code using LLMs like GPT or Claude.

This tool is built with scalability and customization in mind, allowing you to handle even the largest codebases effortlessly. Whether you are generating documentation, searching for bugs, or refactoring code, `code2prompt` provides the flexibility and precision needed for various development tasks.
